# Google Classroom Utility

## Motivation for the App

For a long time, I've been frustrated with the workflow of getting grades in Google Classroom.  The only option is to download a CSV or copy to Google Sheets.  While these are both great options for people that like making mouse clicks, I prefer keeping my hands on the keyboard and punching 2 buttons to get a local, current copy of grades.

## Future of the App

When school starts, I plan on being able to run custom reports that will output in a Skyward friendly form.  Also, I plan on using aggregate functionality in Mongo DB to do some hardcore data wrangling.

## Getting Started

It wouldn't be very difficult to clone the functionality for yourself.  Here's the steps I would follow.  *not tested*

1. Clone or fork the repo.
2. npm install
3. Copy the app-script file into a new App Script project.
4. Enable the API, publish as a web app.
5. Make sure MongoDB is running somewhere.
6. Setup the config.js with a uri.
7. npm start

Holler if you'd like to help or improve the app.
